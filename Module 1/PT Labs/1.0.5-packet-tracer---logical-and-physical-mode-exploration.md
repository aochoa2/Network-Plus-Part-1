## Lab Summary

_Provide a brief summary of what the lab was about. What was the goal or objective?_
The lab seemed to be a way of getting familiar with a virtual environment and how to connect physical wires to hardware. I also messed around the device setting. Learned where the laptops terminal and settings were. Seen what was placed on the rack, the cables on the pegboard, the table with the PC and laptop. The devices on the shelf are unused but there to my disposal.
